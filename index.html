    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Positive Change Movement is a community-driven initiative <strong>Championing Health, Advocacy, and Nurturing Growth and Empowerment (CHANGE)</strong> for People Living with HIV (PLHIV). We aim to dismantle racism, homophobia, and transphobia to help end the HIV epidemic by promoting equity, understanding, and inclusiveness. Through peer support, decriminalization efforts, and stigma reduction, we empower PLHIV and work to dismantle systemic discrimination and inequality. Our programs are guided by lived experiences, ensuring that those most affected have a voice in shaping the future.</p>
