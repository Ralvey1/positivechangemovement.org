        <p>Founded in 2024, Positive Change Movement began with a simple idea: to create a safe, supportive space for People Living with HIV (PLHIV) to connect, share their stories, and advocate for their rights. Over time, we have grown into a statewide initiative, offering services that include peer support groups, advocacy training, and holistic health resources for individuals and communities impacted by HIV.</p>
