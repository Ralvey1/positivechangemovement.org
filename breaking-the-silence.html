    <p>At Positive Change Movement in Kentucky, addressing the weight of stigma is a core part of the work. The judgments people face regarding their sexual orientation, gender expression, HIV status, housing, or substance use often carry feelings of shame and marginalization...</p>

    <blockquote class="highlighted-quote">
        “My family comes from a conservative background, with limited awareness about HIV. There was a lot of judgment tied to sexuality and identity. My family member had no support when diagnosed and couldn’t open up to anyone. Sadly, he passed away because of this stigma.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>This painful experience eventually drove this person to volunteer at a health service organization and later to seek support through Positive Change Movement...</p>

    <blockquote class="highlighted-quote">
        “Fear and resistance to empathy are common,” they added. “When people focus only on risks or negative elements, it amplifies stigma rather than helping address it.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>Ryan Alvey, the Founder and Executive Director of Positive Change Movement, explained that clients tend to focus more on the pain and loneliness they feel rather than explicitly mentioning “stigma.”...</p>

    <blockquote class="highlighted-quote">
        “It’s often about the emotional toll,” Alvey shared. “When we can get specific about what’s happening, it helps us create supportive policies, services, and programs.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>This article explores how stigma affects identity and health, and the ways <strong>Positive Change Movement</strong> fosters community and empowerment through advocacy, support, and safe spaces.</p>
