    <p>At Positive Change Movement in Kentucky, addressing the weight of stigma is a core part of the work. The judgments people face regarding their sexual orientation, gender expression, HIV status, housing, or substance use often carry feelings of shame and marginalization. Even without directly naming it, these sentiments can lead to isolation and harmful consequences.</p>

    <p>One individual, who wished to stay anonymous, shared how HIV stigma contributed to the tragic loss of a loved one.</p>

    <blockquote>“My family comes from a conservative background, with limited awareness about HIV. There was a lot of judgment tied to sexuality and identity. My family member had no support when diagnosed and couldn’t open up to anyone. Sadly, he passed away because of this stigma.”</blockquote>

    <p>This painful experience eventually drove this person to volunteer at a health service organization and, later, to seek support through Positive Change Movement.</p>

    <blockquote>"Even in HIV care and services, some leaders still have not confronted their biases and do not understand how to serve the LGBTQ+ and PLWHIV (People Living with HIV) communities. They lack the unique understanding to support certain groups effectively.”</blockquote>

    <p>They further shared how stigma often stems from people’s disconnect or lack of understanding regarding HIV.</p>

    <blockquote>“Fear and resistance to empathy are common,” they added. “When people focus only on risks or negative elements, it amplifies stigma rather than helping address it.”</blockquote>

    <p>Ryan Alvey, the Founder and Executive Director of Positive Change Movement, explained that clients tend to focus more on the pain and loneliness they feel rather than explicitly mentioning “stigma.”</p>

    <blockquote>“It’s often about the emotional toll,” Alvey shared. “When we can get specific about what’s happening, it helps us create supportive policies, services, and programs. We may not be able to change an entire family or culture, but we can ensure that Positive Change Movement offers a welcoming space where clients feel seen and respected.”</blockquote>

    <blockquote>“It’s everywhere, embedding itself into your life, even your dreams,” said Jorge. “The way to reverse this is by creating safe spaces and providing opportunities to help people reimagine themselves.”</blockquote>

    <p>Jorge highlighted Positive Change Movement’s empowerment group for Latinx women living with HIV, which provides a safe place for women to learn, share their experiences, and receive support.</p>

    <blockquote>“Many of these women bear the burden of keeping their status hidden,” Jorge said. “They have families and children, and they fear rejection from their loved ones. That’s the weight of stigma.”</blockquote>

    <p>Alvey shared that in Pacific Islander culture, the practice of "talking story" is another tool to combat stigma.</p>

    <blockquote>“You find a common ground, a way to connect. HIV may not be the first thing you discuss. You build trust. That’s a core approach at Positive Change Movement—across all our services and programs. It takes more work, more intention, and more time, but in the end, it leads to stronger connections.”</blockquote>

    <p>Jorge, another advocate within the movement, described how people frequently face compounded stigma.</p>

    <blockquote>“There’s stigma around language if English isn’t your first language, stigma connected to immigration, skin color, substance use, and HIV status. These stigmas intersect, shaping people’s self-worth,” he said.</blockquote>

    <p>Jorge recounted a story of someone who, after spending years in the U.S., felt ready to return to their home country to work on recovery from substance use.</p>

    <blockquote>“They had struggled with substance use for a long time and had dealt with legal issues,” Jorge explained. “When they finally decided to reconnect with family, they hesitated, saying, ‘I can’t face them until I’m better.’ The shame around their substance use held them back.”</blockquote>

    <p>This individual’s internalized stigma prevented them from seeking family support.</p>

    <blockquote>“Stigma often impacts you on many levels, embedding itself in you,” Jorge continued. “Creating safe spaces and support systems allows people to break free from this cycle.”</blockquote>

    <p>Alvey noted that representation is another powerful tool to combat stigma.</p>

    <blockquote>“When people openly share what it’s like living with HIV, it helps others feel less alone,” he said. “I know advocates who speak about their experiences as Black women with HIV because they hadn’t seen their stories represented. That visibility makes a difference.”</blockquote>

    <p>This complete article explores the multifaceted impacts of stigma and the supportive, safe spaces created by <strong>Positive Change Movement</strong> in Kentucky to help people find empowerment, community, and understanding.</p>
