      <h2>Positive Change Movement (PCM) Standards for HIV Service Organizations</h2>
      <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> These standards define the minimum conditions for an HIV service organization to be considered:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Community-rooted</li>
        <li>PLHIV-led</li>
        <li>Equitable and accountable</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Organizations that fail to meet these standards should not describe themselves as “community-led,” “equity-focused,” or “PLHIV-centered.”</p>
    </div>

  <summary>10. PCM Minimum Benchmarks</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>PCM considers an HIV service organization non-compliant with community-rooted and PLHIV-centered standards if any of the following are true:
      <ul>
        <li>Board has less than 25% PLHIV or impacted community members.</li>
        <li>No PLHIV in any C-level or director-level roles.</li>
        <li>Leadership resides far from the service area and has no defined on-site engagement requirements.</li>
        <li>No paid PLHIV advisory structure with real power.</li>
        <li>Documented retaliation against PLHIV staff, clients, or whistleblowers.</li>
        <li>No public, accessible financial summary or meaningful transparency about executive pay and major vendors.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Organizations that meet some but not all standards are considered “in transition” and should have a written, time-bound plan, developed with PLHIV and impacted communities, to reach full compliance.</li>
  </ul>
</details>

<details class="standard-section">
  <summary>11. How PCM Uses These Standards</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Positive Change Movement will use these standards to:
      <ul>
        <li>Assess HIV service organizations for:
          <ul>
            <li>Advocacy and watchdog reporting</li>
            <li>Public statements and scorecards</li>
            <li>Partnership decisions.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Inform letters to:
          <ul>
            <li>Funders</li>
            <li>Regulators</li>
            <li>Legislators</li>
            <li>Community partners.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Develop tools (e.g., EvalU, Fiscal Watchdog) that measure:
          <ul>
            <li>Governance and leadership</li>
            <li>Equity and MIPA</li>
            <li>Financial and programmatic accountability.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Organizations are free to adopt these standards in whole or in part. If they choose not to, they should be prepared to explain to PLHIV and impacted communities why they believe we deserve less.</li>
  </ul>
